下面是assignment的格式和大致内容：In this assignment, we will be working on a multi-class classification problem. You will have to build a model that can predict the credit rating of bank customer based on their personal information and financial profile. The results of your model will be used for offering personalised products to existing customers or recommend changes to their existing accounts. Assignment: You will have to design and run your own experiments for this project. You will have to recommend which performance metrics are good fit for this business goal. You can use any algorithm of your choice (only the ones that are available in the Sklearn package) and tune any hyperparameters. You need to perform (and submit) at least 4 different experiments. You can do more if you wish. This assignment requires you to run multiple notebooks with the following instructions: EDA Notebook: Define the business use case and users for your models. Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset. Preparation Notebook: Apply data transformation, data cleansing and feature engineering required for training ML models Pick any number of numerical and/or categorical features of your choice from the dataset Baseline Notebook: Assess the performance of a baseline model using appropriate metrics Experiment 1 Notebook: Perform any additional analysis, data preparation, feature selection, feature engineering you deem necessary Train a ML models with hyperperparameter tuning Make recommendations for next the experiment Experiment 2 Notebook: Perform any additional analysis, data preparation, feature selection, feature engineering you deem necessary Train a ML models with hyperperparameter tuning Make recommendations for next the experiment Experiment 3 Notebook: Perform any additional analysis, data preparation, feature selection, feature engineering you deem necessary Train a ML models with hyperperparameter tuning Make recommendations for next the experiment Experiment 4 Notebook: Perform any additional analysis, data preparation, feature selection, feature engineering you deem necessary Train a ML models with hyperperparameter tuning Make recommendations for next the experiment You will need to fill out each notebook with your Python code but also provide detailed explanations and relevant insights in the required cells. Each section that requires your input has been marked with the tag <Student to fill this section>. Do not forget to comment your code for readability purposes. You will use the following Notebook templates: 36106-AT2-student_id-a-EDA.ipynbDownload 36106-AT2-student_id-a-EDA.ipynb 36106-AT2-student_id-b-Preparation.ipynbDownload 36106-AT2-student_id-b-Preparation.ipynb 36106-AT2-student_id-0-Baseline.ipynbDownload 36106-AT2-student_id-0-Baseline.ipynb 36106-AT2-student_id-1-experiment-1.ipynbDownload 36106-AT2-student_id-1-experiment-1.ipynb 36106-AT2-student_id-2-experiment-2.ipynbDownload 36106-AT2-student_id-2-experiment-2.ipynb 36106-AT2-student_id-3-experiment-3.ipynbDownload 36106-AT2-student_id-3-experiment-3.ipynb 36106-AT2-student_id-4-experiment-4.ipynbDownload 36106-AT2-student_id-4-experiment-4.ipynb Some code has already been implemented in the notebooks. You should not modify them and should use the defined variables as-is. Note: You need to save all datasets in the sub-folder from where your notebooks are: 36106/assignment/AT2/data At the end of the experimentation phase (i.e. after completing all experiments), you will write a final report presenting the business use case that will benefit from your machine learning model predictions, the dataset used for training, the approaches you took during your experimentation phase, best results achieved, analysis on correct and incorrect predictions, business impacts and ethical consideration of your model and final recommendation. The report should not exceed 3500 words.

以下是Baseline+Experiment部分的思路,请依照先前给出的模板和上述对项目及preperation的理解帮助我处理数据和提供代码，要求代码简单易读，注释包含中英文，模板中的每个问题都得到了充分的中英文版本解答并且满足评分标准：
总体思路

Baseline：要选一个简单、可解释的模型，作为零起点。

Experiments：逐步尝试不同算法，从简单线性 → 树模型 → 集成方法，结合你的数据特点（多类别、类别不均衡、数值+类别混合）。

评分标准里有一条：“multiple experiments with proper justification and hyperparameter tuning”，所以至少 4 个实验要有逻辑递进，不是随便堆模型。

1. Baseline 推荐

Logistic Regression (multinomial / softmax)

原因：

简单、可解释；

与评分标准的 “clear baseline” 对齐；

在 balanced accuracy 或 macro-F1 上不会太好，但能说明 class imbalance 的问题。

Baseline metric：

精确率 (Precision) / 召回率 (Recall) / F1-score (macro average)

Balanced accuracy（因为类别分布 53% / 29% / 18% 有点不均衡）

2. Experiment 1 — Tree-based 单模型

Decision Tree (CART)

目标：验证非线性决策边界是否能捕捉特征之间的交互。

优点：可解释、特征重要性直观。

缺点：容易过拟合。

超参数：max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf。

3. Experiment 2 — 集成 Bagging

Random Forest

原因：

天然适合数值+类别混合（我们已经标准化，不影响它，但不标准化它也能跑）。

对特征冗余/共线性不敏感。

超参数：n_estimators, max_depth, max_features。

评估重点：对 minority class (Good ~18%) 的召回率提升。

4. Experiment 3 — Gradient Boosting

XGBoost / LightGBM (sklearn wrapper)

优势：在 Kaggle/业界中信用风险场景非常常见，拟合能力强。

在本数据集里，可以验证：Boosting 是否比 Bagging 更好捕捉复杂模式。

超参数：n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, subsample。

注意：Boosting 模型容易过拟合，要配合交叉验证。

5. Experiment 4 — Linear vs Kernel 方法

Support Vector Machine (SVM, One-vs-Rest / One-vs-One)

适合中小数据（12,500 样本完全可行）。

标准化后特征适配性好。

尤其在类别边界较复杂时，RBF kernel 可能表现不错。

缺点：训练速度比 RF/XGB 慢。

（可选扩展 Experiment 5）

Logistic Regression with class weights（加上 class_weight="balanced"），对比 baseline，可以展示你如何应对类别不平衡。

或者 简单 MLP (sklearn MLPClassifier)，展示非线性神经网络的表现。

✍️ 如何在报告里解释选择

Baseline：逻辑回归 → “简单、可解释、明确基准”。

Decision Tree：探索非线性结构 → “模型可解释性强”。

Random Forest：降低单树过拟合 → “更鲁棒的集成方法”。

XGBoost：提升复杂模式捕捉能力 → “业界常用信用评分模型”。

SVM（或 MLP）：增加对比，展示不同算法范式。

这样递进结构清晰，满足评分要求的“experimentation + justification”。

Data Understanding

The dataset contains demographic, behavioral, and financial information for individual credit customers, including income, debt, repayment history, and account activity. The target variable credit_rating classifies customers as Good, Standard, or Poor based on creditworthiness.
Overall, the dataset is balanced enough for modeling, but with some skew toward the Standard class. Numerical variables such as annual_income, outstanding_debt, and credit_history_years describe financial capacity and experience, while behavioral features such as min_amount_payment and payment_behaviour capture repayment habits.

🔍 Target Variable Analysis

credit_rating is the main target. Most customers are Standard (about half of total), while Poor and Good groups are smaller.
This imbalance is acceptable but suggests that evaluation metrics such as macro-F1 or balanced accuracy should be used rather than plain accuracy.
The three classes also show meaningful behavioral differences in later feature comparisons, which supports the quality of the labeling.

📊 Feature Exploration

Financial indicators

annual_income and outstanding_debt show strong right skew. After log transformation, the distribution becomes smoother.

dti = (outstanding_debt * 12) / annual_income correctly reflects debt pressure. Poor customers have much higher DTI, showing clear separation.

emi_to_income has a small range (<0.1 for most). Higher ratios link to higher credit risk.

Repayment and delinquency

avg_days_past_due and count_delayed_payment both correlate strongly with Poor credit ratings. Negative values were fixed to 0.

These features clearly describe repayment discipline and should be standardized for modeling.

Credit behavior

count_credit_inquiries and loans_count show how actively customers seek credit. Higher counts are strongly linked to Poor credit ratings.

credit_history_years is more interpretable and stable than months, and longer histories are associated with Good ratings.

credit_ratio (utilization rate) has moderate correlation with credit risk, especially above 35%.

Categorical features

min_amount_payment: “Yes” responses are more common among Poor customers, indicating repayment stress.

payment_behaviour: customers with High spend and large/medium payments are mostly Good or Standard.

⚠️ Data Quality & Limitations

Several issues were identified:

Some variables (e.g., avg_days_past_due) contain unrealistic negative values.

Strong redundancy exists between credit_history_months and credit_history_years; only one should remain.

Derived variables such as dti and emi_to_income depend on accurate income data, so outliers must be checked.

Category definitions in payment_behaviour are vague and may need regrouping for better interpretability.

Despite these issues, most features are complete, consistent, and suitable for predictive modeling after cleaning and transformation.

💡 Insights for Modeling

Key predictors expected to have high importance:
count_credit_inquiries, credit_history_years, outstanding_debt/dti, loans_count, min_amount_payment.

Supporting variables:
credit_ratio, emi_to_income, and payment_behaviour — weaker individually but potentially valuable in interaction.

Features should be standardized or log-transformed before modeling, and categorical variables should be properly encoded.

Data imbalance should be handled by stratified sampling or performance metrics suited for multi-class imbalance.

Data Preparation Summary (for Report / Notebook)

English Version (recommended for submission)

The data preparation process aimed to ensure data quality, reproducibility, and ethical soundness prior to model training.
After exploring the dataset, no missing values or duplicate rows were found, but several variables required cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to reduce skewness, multicollinearity, and potential data leakage.

1. Data Cleaning

Removed or masked personally identifiable information (PII) such as customer_id, full_name, email, phone_number, and address-related fields to ensure privacy compliance and avoid irrelevant noise.

Corrected negative or invalid values (e.g., negative avg_days_past_due and monthly_emi_payment set to 0).

Verified data consistency: count_credit_history_years was likely expressed in months, so a corrected feature credit_history_years = count_credit_history_years / 12 was created.

2. Outlier Handling and Transformation

Long-tailed monetary variables (annual_income, outstanding_debt, _monthly_invested_amount, monthly_balance) were log-transformed using log1p to reduce skewness.

Ratio-type variables (credit_ratio, dti, emi_to_income) were capped (winsorized) to minimize the influence of extreme outliers.

All numeric features were standardized (mean 0, std 1) fitted only on the training set, ensuring no data leakage from validation or test sets.

3. Feature Engineering

Engineered financial behavior indicators:

dti = (outstanding_debt * 12) / annual_income – debt pressure ratio.

emi_to_income = (monthly_emi_payment * 12) / annual_income – repayment burden indicator.

Constructed low-dimensional signals from the nine historical loan-type columns (last_1_loan_type … last_9_loan_type):

Binary indicator for “Has any loan” (vs “No Loan”);

Binary indicator for “High-risk loan” (presence of Payday Loan);

Loan-type diversity index (number of distinct loan types per customer).
These transformations avoided the creation of 90+ one-hot variables and improved interpretability.

4. Feature Selection and Multicollinearity Control

Domain-knowledge and statistical checks (Spearman correlation + VIF) guided feature pruning.

Removed redundant raw fields strongly correlated with derived features:

annual_income, outstanding_debt, monthly_emi_payment, _monthly_invested_amount, monthly_balance (replaced by transformed or ratio features).

All original last_k_loan_type columns were dropped after the low-dimensional encoding.

Kept behaviorally relevant and ethically valid variables such as count_credit_inquiries, count_delayed_payment, avg_days_past_due, credit_history_years, and min_amount_payment.

5. Data Splitting and Scaling

Dataset was stratified into train (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) subsets to preserve class distribution (Good, Standard, Poor).

The validation set provides a fixed baseline for models that do not use cross-validation, while 5-fold cross-validation will be applied on the training set for more robust model tuning.

6. Potential Leakage Features (used only in controlled experiments)

Four features (credit_mix, cc_interest_rate, credit_limit_change, gender) were identified as potential sources of data leakage or ethical bias:

credit_mix closely mirrors the target label structure.

cc_interest_rate and credit_limit_change may be determined after credit rating assignment.

gender is sensitive and may cause fairness bias.

These features were excluded from the main training pipeline, but retained in controlled comparative experiments to measure their performance impact and ethical implications.
This dual approach ensures transparency and supports a deeper discussion on model fairness and generalizability.

HGB：boosting 捕捉非线性残差，校准更好，适合阈值决策。

SVM：核方法提高 Good 召回，但整体宏平均下降，作为对照很有价值。

调参策略：Randomized → Grid → Narrow；最后以稳定性 + 简单优先定版（RF 例：max_depth≈16–17, leaf=3, sqrt, n_estimators≈400–500）。

3) Ethics & privacy / 伦理与隐私（含 Indigenous/受众反思）

credit_mix：准标签风险（可能来源于内部评级/策略映射）；需谨慎使用或仅保留转换/交互版。

interest_rate/limit_change：策略同源 → 明确信息泄漏；不可用于部署。

gender：群体公平性风险；不纳入生产模型；建议分组阈值/监控与透明说明。

受影响方：客户（尤其女性或特定群体）、信贷合规团队、业务风险与品牌。

建议：上线 SAFE 特征集；定期做 drift/PSI、公平性指标（按性别/地区等）监控。

4) Communication & visuals / 沟通与可视化

One-paragraph conclusion（可直接贴入报告结尾）

EN:
With the corrected ablations, each experiment isolates a single risk factor: credit_mix (Exp2), strategy-derived variables (Exp3), and gender (Exp4). The ablations quantify how quasi-label or policy artifacts can artificially inflate metrics, while gender brings fairness concerns without robust gains. The RF-SAFE model with a compact, interpretable feature set offers the best balance of accuracy and stability; HGB-SAFE provides better calibration for policy thresholds. We recommend deploying RF-SAFE with calibrated thresholds and continuous fairness/shift monitoring, and using HGB-SAFE as a complementary probability estimator.

补充一下对于leak特征理解错误的实验摘要和实验总结（如有冲突以修正后的内容为准）：

1) Executive Summary / 执行摘要

EN (short):
Across four experiments on multi-class credit rating (Good/Standard/Poor), ensemble tree models performed best. Random Forest with top-20 interpretable features was the most balanced and stable (Val/Test macro-F1 ≈ 0.639/0.639, bAcc ≈ 0.668/0.664). Histogram Gradient Boosting matched RF on test (~0.646 macro-F1) and offered better probability calibration. SVM maximized minority (Good) recall but hurt Standard recall and overall macro-F1. Controlled “leakage” (using cc_interest_rate/credit_limit_change) inflated macro-F1 by ~+0.03 but is not deployable. Gender brought ethical risks with little robust gain.

中文（简要）：
在四组实验中，集成树模型效果最佳。基于 Top-20 可解释特征 的 随机森林最稳健（验证/测试 macro-F1 约 0.639/0.639，bAcc 约 0.668/0.664）。HGB 测试集达到 ~0.646 macro-F1，并提供更好的概率校准。SVM 强化了少数类（Good）召回，但牺牲了 Standard 类与总体 macro-F1。使用疑似泄漏变量（cc_interest_rate/credit_limit_change）可把分数推高 ≈+0.03，但不具可部署性；gender 存在公平性风险，收益有限。

2) Experimental Setup Summary / 实验设置概览

Data split / 划分：分层 70/15/15（train/val/test），确保可用于 CV。

Target：credit_rating（Good / Standard / Poor），类别不均衡（约 18% / 53% / 29%）。

Metrics / 指标：Macro-F1（主）、Balanced Accuracy、（补充）OvR ROC-AUC。

Feature policy / 特征策略：剔除 PII；采用可解释、业务相关的数值/类别特征；构造 log1p__ 金额、dti、emi_to_income 等；OHE 后对 credit_mix*/gender* 进行对照剔除；不引入已知策略变量（利率、额度调整）作为最终模型特征。

Imbalance：树模型用 class_weight="balanced"；HGB 用 sample_weight；SVM 同样使用 class_weight="balanced"。

3) Results by Experiment / 分实验结果
Exp1 — Decision Tree（非线性可解释基线）

Best params: max_depth=6, min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2
Val: macro-F1 0.628, bAcc 0.646
Test: macro-F1 0.638, bAcc 0.650

EN: Simple, interpretable non-linear baseline. Strong recall for Poor (≈0.75), moderate for Good (≈0.56), lower for Standard.
CN： 简单可解释的非线性基线。Poor 召回高（~0.75），Good 中等（~0.56），Standard 偏低。为后续集成学习提供了清晰起点和重要性参考。

Exp2 — Random Forest（Top-20 可解释特征 + 对照/泄漏检验）

Search & fine-tune:

Randomized → Grid → Narrow grid；稳定参数：
n_estimators=500, max_depth=17, min_samples_leaf=3, max_features='sqrt', class_weight='balanced'
Stability check: 多随机种子波动小（Δ macro-F1 ≈ 0.003）。

SAFE（无泄漏/无敏感）

Val: macro-F1 0.639, bAcc 0.668

Test: macro-F1 0.639, bAcc 0.664

Per-class (Val)：Good 0.68 R, Poor 0.73 R, Standard 0.60 R；Precision 对 Standard 更高（谨慎预测）。

LEAK（含 cc_interest_rate + credit_limit_change）

Val: macro-F1 0.670, bAcc 0.711

Test: macro-F1 0.668, bAcc 0.703

Observation / 现象：分数显著提升，但本质上“学习了银行策略”，信息泄漏风险大，不可部署。

Top features（SAFE）（一致性强）：
log1p__outstanding_debt, min_amount_payment_Yes, avg_days_past_due, credit_history_years, dti, count_credit_inquiries, count_delayed_payment, count_bank_accounts, log1p__annual_income, emi_to_income …
Interpretation / 解释：债务水平、逾期天数、是否仅付最低还款、信用历史年限与评级强相关，符合信用业务常识。

Exp3 — Histogram Gradient Boosting（HGB，延续 Top-20 + 泄漏对照）

Randomized & Grid（SAFE）：

CV best ~ 0.632，最终 Val 0.630, Test 0.646（bAcc ~0.682）

Minority recall：Good ~0.72, Poor ~0.74；Standard recall 较低，但 Precision 更高（更“保守”）。

Calibration & PDP（补充分析建议）：概率更平滑、PDP 显示债务与 DTI 的非线性影响，解释性较强。

LEAK（含策略变量）：

Randomized best CV ~0.654 → 同样显示“泄漏增益”，不可用于生产。

Conclusion / 小结：HGB 与 RF 表现相近，HGB 概率校准更好，对 minority recall 更积极；RF 更均衡稳健。

Exp4 — SVM (RBF)（Top-15 特征 + 性别公平性对照）

Best params: C=1, gamma=0.2, class_weight='balanced'
SAFE：

Val: macro-F1 0.605, bAcc 0.663, OvR AUC 0.783

Test: macro-F1 0.616, bAcc 0.672, OvR AUC 0.795

Pattern：Good 召回很高（Val ~0.78），但 Standard 召回偏低（~0.49），整体宏平均下降。

LEAK (gender 对照)：

CV best ~0.606；加入 gender 并无稳定的总体提升，却引入公平性风险（潜在群体偏置）。

Conclusion / 小结：SVM 擅长 minority recall，但损失 majority 平衡；不作为最终方案，可作为风险偏好更激进场景的备选。

4) Cross-Experiment Insights / 跨实验洞见（对照 + 伦理）
Leakage controls / 泄漏对照结论

添加 cc_interest_rate 与 credit_limit_change 会显著抬高 macro-F1（RF: 0.639 → 0.670；HGB: ~0.63 → ~0.65）。

解释：这两者反映银行内部风险定价/额度策略，与 credit_rating 同源，模型学习到“策略捷径”而非真实信用行为。

结论：不可用于生产，仅用于研究对照；报告中说明“higher accuracy ≠ reliable generalization”。

Fairness reflection / 公平性反思

gender 在 SVM 对照中没有稳定收益，却可能导致群体不公平（不同性别召回/误报差异）。

结论：不纳入生产特征；建议后续使用去偏方法（如 reweighting、group thresholds）做监控与校正。

Feature policy / 特征策略

RF/HGB 的重要性排序一致性高，说明两类模型依赖的核心信号稳定，可解释性强。

credit_mix 可保留“安全版本”（有序编码或与 DTI 的交互），但避免其成为“准标签”。在本项目中我们已采用安全集为主。

5) Business Impact & Decision / 业务影响与决策建议

EN:

Identify prime (Good): RF/HGB significantly improved recall vs baseline, enabling better cross-sell/limit increase decisions; HGB is slightly more aggressive for Good recall.

Control risk (Poor): Both RF and HGB maintain high recall for Poor, reducing credit loss.

Standard class: RF is more balanced (higher recall than HGB/SVM), thus better for day-to-day risk management.

Final pick: RF (Top-20, SAFE) as the primary model, HGB as a calibrated companion (probability outputs for policy thresholds).

中文：

优质客户识别（Good）：RF/HGB 明显提升 Good 召回，有助于额度提升与个性化营销；HGB 在 Good 上略更积极。

高风险控制（Poor）：两者对 Poor 的召回稳定，降低不良风险。

标准客户（Standard）：RF 更均衡，适合常规风控场景。

最终推荐：以 RF（Top-20，安全特征集） 为主模型；HGB 作为概率更稳的校准模型（用于阈值策略/分层定价）。

6) Reproducibility & Error Sources / 可复现性与误差来源

EN:

Fixed 70/15/15 split; StratifiedKFold=5 with a fixed seed for CV comparability.

Small metric differences (≤0.003 macro-F1) across nearby RF settings are within CV variance.

Potential errors: mild label noise, synthetic data patterns, and overlapping class boundaries (seen in Standard vs others).
CN：

固定分层划分与 CV 随机种子，保证可比性；

RF 相邻设置差异 ≤0.003 属于 CV 方差范围；

潜在误差来源：标签噪声、合成数据模式、类间边界重叠（Standard 更明显）。

7) Final Model & Operating Policy / 最终模型与策略

Chosen model / 最终模型：Random Forest (SAFE, Top-20)
n_estimators=500, max_depth=17, min_samples_leaf=3, max_features='sqrt', class_weight='balanced'

Operating policy / 运行策略（建议）

Thresholds / 阈值：按业务偏好在验证集做阈值扫描（对 Good/Poor 的 class-wise 概率阈值），在测试集固化。

Score bands / 评分分层：将预测概率分层（如 Low/Med/High risk）输出，便于产品策略落地。

Monitoring / 监控：每月跟踪 macro-F1、per-class recall、PSI（人口稳定性指标）与 fairness 指标（性别/地区等）。

Fallback / 兜底：当外部分布漂移或监管要求增强时，可切换到 HGB（校准更佳）或启用 RF+HGB 软投票做稳定化。

One-paragraph Conclusion / 一段式结论（可直接放报告结尾）

EN:
The experimentation demonstrates a clear progression from a simple interpretable baseline (Decision Tree) to robust ensembles (Random Forest, HGB) and a kernel method (SVM). Random Forest with a compact, interpretable feature set provides the best balance of accuracy (macro-F1 ≈ 0.64), stability, and operational simplicity. HGB delivers comparable accuracy with better probability calibration, making it a strong companion for threshold-based policies. Leakage and fairness ablations show that strategy-driven or demographic features can inflate metrics but undermine deployability. We therefore recommend deploying the RF-SAFE model with calibrated thresholds and continuous monitoring, and retaining HGB for probability calibration and policy sensitivity analyses.

中文：
本项目形成了从可解释基线到集成与核方法的清晰递进。采用 Top-20 可解释特征 的 随机森林在准确性、稳定性与落地复杂度之间取得最佳平衡（macro-F1 约 0.64）。HGB 提供相近准确率并具更佳的概率校准，适合作为阈值策略的辅助模型。对照实验表明：将策略/人口特征纳入模型虽能提升分数，但会削弱可部署性与公平性。因此建议上线 RF-SAFE，配合阈值校准与持续监控，并保留 HGB 用于概率标定与策略敏感性分析。
